# Verifying-the-normal-theory-with-real-data
The standard assumptions can
hardly be excepted to hold in practice. The difficulty is that, in practice, we do not know the truth
(compare with the setting of Problem verifying the normal theory when the model is correct.
Here is one way to assess how reliable the normal theory is in practice. 
Consider the 04cars dataset (we focus on complete observations). 
This could beconsidered the entire `population' of cars sold in the US in 2004 and, if this were the case, then it
could be hard to justify performing statistical inference. 
More appropriate would be a descriptive analysis. 
So let's use that as the entire population. 
We simulate a situation where we only have access to a sample from the population. 
We focus on mpg and hp .
