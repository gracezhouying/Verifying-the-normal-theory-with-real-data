proportion
#the proportion is about 0.8XX, this shows that the sample model of size 50 somewhat in accordance with the entire model,
however, it is not very accurate since the proportion is not very close to 1.

#B.Plot the LS slope coefficients from the simulation as a histogram, what distribution would you expect?
hist(vecslope,prob=TRUE,breaks=50)
# the distribution is almost a normal distribution.
